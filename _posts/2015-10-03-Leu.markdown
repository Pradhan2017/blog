Michailia Verou, A.K.A Lea Verou has a very technical background; she is a computer scientist, web standards geek, front-end developer. She is now a Research assistant at MIT CSAIL, and also an invited in the W3C CSS working group. Verou has written a book about advanced CSS, given 60+ talks around the globe. 

She is currently writing a book about all her CSS knowledge, in a recent blog post she mentions how difficult it has been to write the book and work for MIT at the same time.
She has a presence on Twitter, Facebook, Lanyrd, LinkedIn, dribbble, and definitely on Github.

Lea has recently coded her own autocomplete feature, I find it crazy and inspiring. I look forward to have the skill set to create things that can be beneficial to all web users.
